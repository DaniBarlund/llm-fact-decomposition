# Fact Decomposition Pipeline with LLMs

This repository is dedicated to building a **Fact Decomposition Pipeline** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The goal is to analyze generated text, identify individual facts, and detect potential hallucinations (inaccurate or fabricated information).

## Key Features

- **Fact Identification**: Break down complex, generated text into distinct factual statements.
- **Hallucination Detection**: Evaluate the accuracy of identified facts and flag potential hallucinations.
- **Pipeline Approach**: Modular design for easy integration, testing, and extension.
- **LLM Integration**: Leverage state-of-the-art LLMs for fact extraction and validation.

## Planned Components

1. **Fact Extraction**: Decompose the text into standalone factual statements.
2. **Fact Verification**: Validate extracted facts against trusted sources or datasets.
3. **Data Output**: Return identified facts, their verification status, and flagged hallucinations in a structured JSON format for easy integration with other systems.

## Goals

This project aims to:
- Enhance the reliability of generative AI outputs.
- Provide a tool to support critical applications like content moderation, research, and automated reporting.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests to improve the pipeline.
